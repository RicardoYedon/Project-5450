Week 1: Data Understanding, Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tasks:

Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
Load all necessary datasets (ratings.csv, movies_metadata.csv, links_small.csv, credits.csv, keywords.csv).
Perform an initial exploration to understand the structure and content of each dataset.
Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values and data type inconsistencies.
Convert data types where necessary (e.g., IDs to integers).
Merge datasets to create a cohesive and comprehensive data source.
Handle any duplicates or irrelevant data.
Feature Engineering:
Process and extract relevant features from the data (e.g., genres, keywords, cast, crew).
Create new features such as the "soup" for content-based filtering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct detailed EDA to gain insights into the data.
Generate at least three meaningful visuals:
Distribution of movie ratings.
Number of ratings per movie.
Relationship between average rating and the number of ratings per movie.
Identify patterns, trends, and potential issues in the data.
Baseline Model Implementation:
Implement the baseline model using the global mean rating.
Evaluate its performance using RMSE.
Comment on the baseline performance and identify areas for improvement.
Goal: Have a clean, well-understood dataset ready for modeling, with insights gained from EDA and baseline metrics established.

Week 2: Advanced Modeling and Initial Evaluation
Tasks:

Implement K-NN Collaborative Filtering:
Develop a user-based or item-based K-NN model.
Handle data sparsity and ensure the model can make predictions for the test set.
Evaluate the model using RMSE and compare it to the baseline.
Implement SVD-based Matrix Factorization:
Apply SVD to the user-item interaction matrix.
Optimize the number of latent factors.
Reconstruct the ratings matrix and make predictions.
Evaluate the model using RMSE and compare it to both the baseline and K-NN models.
Implement Content-Based Filtering:
Utilize movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, director) to compute content similarity.
Develop a content-based recommendation function.
Test the model with example inputs.
Initial Model Comparison:
Compare the performance of the advanced models.
Identify strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Begin formulating hypotheses based on initial results.
Goal: Develop advanced models that improve upon the baseline, understand their performance, and prepare for further optimization.

Week 3: Model Optimization, Hypothesis Testing, and Project Finalization
Tasks:

Develop Hybrid Recommendation System:
Combine collaborative and content-based filtering methods.
Address cold-start problems and enhance recommendation quality.
Implement a function for hybrid recommendations.
Model Fine-Tuning and Cross-Validation:
Perform hyperparameter tuning for K-NN (e.g., different values of k, similarity metrics).
Optimize SVD by adjusting latent factors and regularization parameters.
Use cross-validation to assess model stability and prevent overfitting.
Hypothesis Formulation and Testing:
Clearly state hypotheses regarding model performance.
Example Hypotheses:
Advanced models significantly reduce RMSE compared to the baseline.
The hybrid model outperforms individual models.
Statistical Testing:
Use paired t-tests to compare model performances.
Analyze p-values to accept or reject hypotheses.
Final Analysis and Reporting:
Compile all results, including EDA findings, model evaluations, and hypothesis testing outcomes.
Create visualizations to support conclusions (e.g., RMSE comparison charts, p-value tables).
Discuss any limitations and potential improvements.
Project Deliverables Preparation:
Write a comprehensive report detailing methodology, results, and conclusions.
Prepare presentation materials if required (slides, summary documents).
Ensure all code is well-documented and reproducible.
Goal: Finalize the project with validated findings, complete deliverables, and be ready for any presentations or submissions.
